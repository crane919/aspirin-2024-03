I found that the functional programs had fewer lines of code than the prescriptive ones, which made them feel easier to digest. However, since I'm unfamiliar with all of the functional syntax, it made things more difficult for me. So, I think the prescriptive ones are currently more readable. I liked that the functional ones are harder to introduce bugs into, as I don't have to keep track of all the little details. However, it would take me a while to figure out which functions I needed to use. Since my brain is more accustomed to prescriptive coding, I think I still code more quickly that way. However, since functional programming reduces the occurrence of small bugs and results in less code overall, I think I will keep trying to learn how to do it.
